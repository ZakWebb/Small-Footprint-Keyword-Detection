# Small-Footprint-Keyword-Detection


The goal of this is to create a deployable keyword detection system on a microcontroller.  I'm still in the process of learning the state-of-the-art, so I'll also be including relevant literature.  

Keywords: keyword spotting, small-footprint, wake word detection, embedded deep learning
